# UCLA Project 2
## Red vs. Blue Engagement
### by Kurt Anderson

In this project I will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I will play the roles of both Pentester and Security Operations Center Analyst.

As the Red Team, I will attack a vulnerable VM within my created virtual environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine.
As the Blue Team, I will use Kibana to review logs taken during the Red Team engagement. I will then use the logs to extract hard data and visulaizations for my report, using it to interpret my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed as a Pentester.
